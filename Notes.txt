Main ideas of js:

1 save data == in objects, key-value pairs or in array or string
2 generate HTML == 2. using arrow functions to find matching,
       1. get code from .html like divs to generate html,  
       3. use dom to put it into web page. 
       for dom use/add/create another class 
 2.1 combine this html together
 2.2 put it on web page(using dom)
3 Make it interactive
  3.1 how do we know which prdct to add?
  data attribute : is just another HTML attribute
  it allows us to attach any information to an element

  syntax for a data attribut:
  is just an HTML attribute
  it have to start with "data-"
  then give it any name

  name              value
  data-prdct-name="${prdct.name}">



  steps:
  1. check if the prdct is already in the cart
  2. if it is in the cart, increase the quantity
  3.if it is not in thecart, add it to the cart.

to avoid naming conflicts we create Module

Create a Module:
1. create a file
2. Dont load the file with <script>

Any variables we create inside the file, 
will be contained inside the file

-Get a variable out of a file:
1.Add type="module" attribute
2. Export
3. Import

--Benefits of Module:
1.avoid naming conflicts
2. dont have to worry about order of files
3. using modules we can reuse a lot of code and reduce complexions
  (Here-formatCurrency function in scripts/utils/money.js used in shopnow.js and checkout.js)


==Group related code together into its own file

--import * as cartModule from'../data/cart.js';
it imports everything from cart.js
cartModule.cart
cartModule.addToCarr('id')
